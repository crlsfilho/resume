-   skill: Languages 
    description: Since I'm Brazilian, I'm a native Portuguese speaker. I'm also fluent in English and my Spanish is intermediate. I do speak a little French and have some basic notions of Italian and German. 

-   skill: Coding  
    description: I'm skilled with HTML, CSS, and JS. I've been studying Python/R/SQL too, so I can make sense of data and crawl things. I also know one thing or two of Bootstrap and Jekyll, and the basics of some backend languages like Ruby. 
    
-   skill: Creative  
    description: I've been using Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere and a little of After Effects) for quite a while, which can contribute with my eye for design. Copywriting and creative writing are also major for me, and I also have a thing for multimedia (photography and video are my favorites).
